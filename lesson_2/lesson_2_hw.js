// --- Resolving Expressions ---
// Task 1: Experiment with different arithmetic expressions
console.log(3 * '5'); // What happens when a string is multiplied by a number?
console.log('5' - 2); // What happens when a string is subtracted by a number?
console.log("5" ** 2); // What happens when a string is exponentiated?
console.log(5 + 3 * 2); // What happens when multiplication is done before addition?

// Task 2: Investigate logical operators with different data types
console.log(false && "apple"); // What is the result of AND between boolean and string?
console.log(true || 0); // What happens when OR is used between boolean and number?
console.log('hello' && 10); // What happens when AND is used between string and number?
console.log(null || 7); // What happens when OR is used with null?

// --- Conditional Statements ---

// Task 3: Determine the discount on an item based on price. Create your rules for discoun.
const price = 120; // Replace with different values to test
let discount = 0;



console.log(`The discount is: $${discount}`);

// Task 4: Determine if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5
const num1 = 15; // Replace with any number


// Task 5: Write a program to check the grade: A(form 90 to 100)
//  B(from 80 to 90), C(from 70 to 80), D(60 to 70), F(0 to 60) based on the score
const score = 85; // Replace with different scores


// // Task 6: Determine the Day of the Week
// Example number of the day
const dayNumber = 3; // Replace this with any number from 1(Monday) to 7(Sunday)
// Using a switch statement to determine the day


// Output the result
console.log(dayName);


// --- Loops ---

// Task 7: Print numbers from 100 down to 1 using a `while` loop
let num2 = 100;


// Task 8: Calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5) using a `for` loop
const num3 = 5;



// --- Advanced Task: Nested Loops ---

// Task 9: Create a multiplication table for numbers 1-10 using nested loops

// Task 10: Draw a checkerboard pattern using nested loops


// Task 11: Find the smallest number in a set of numbers (without using arrays)
const num5 = 45;
const num6 = 8;
const num7 = 23;
const num8 = 78;
